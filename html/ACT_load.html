        <h1>ACT Load</h1>
        <p>This plugin loads pages and posts from the following sources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Load Single JSON Page - JSON files downloaded from the WP REST API into subdirectories of newsite</li>
            <li>Load Pages and Posts - Wordpress pages and posts from a legacy site</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Load Single JSON Page</h2>
        <p>Takes a json file downloaded from the Wordpress REST API (as used in https://actionclimateteignbridge.org/newsite
            and imports it to the current site, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Moving any images</li>
                <li>Converting links to newsite and cc.actionclimateteignbridge.org/wordpress</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>NOTE - this was used early in the loading development to recover a couple of pages from newsite to oldsite.
            It is not expected that it will be used long term.
        </p>
        <h2>Load Pages and Posts</h2>
        <p>Loads posts, pages, team members from various sites to the current site. The following are transformed in the process:
            <ul>
                <li>Images are reduced to no more than 200kb and no more than 300 X 300 pixels</li>
                <li>Links internal to the site are changed so they still work (more detail later)</li>
                <li>Categories are rationalise (see below)</li>
                <li>Authors are mapped to users on the current site</li>
                <li>Comments are copied</li>
                <li>Featured media is set</li>
                <li>Any post excerpt is set</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
